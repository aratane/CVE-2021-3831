# PHP Exploit CVE-2021-3831 Script

## Overview

This PHP script is designed to interact with a target website by generating specific MD5 hashes and making HTTP requests to exploit potential vulnerabilities. It is intended for educational purposes and should only be used in environments where you have explicit permission to test for vulnerabilities.

## Features

- **Dynamic Target Input:** The script accepts a target URL as a command-line argument, allowing for flexible usage.
- **Secure HTTP Requests:** Utilizes `cURL` for making HTTP requests, providing robust error handling and security.
- **Error Logging:** Logs errors to help with debugging and monitoring script execution.
- **Modular Design:** The script is structured with clear function definitions for better readability and maintenance.

## How It Works

1. **MD5 Hash Generation:** The script generates MD5 hashes based on the target URL and predefined strings.
2. **HTTP Requests:** It makes several HTTP requests to the target and related services using the generated hashes.
3. **Response Handling:** The script processes the responses to determine the success of the exploit attempt.

## Usage
