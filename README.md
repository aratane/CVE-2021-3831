# Improvements:
Encapsulation: Added a generateMd5 function to encapsulate the MD5 generation logic.
Main Function: Created executeExploit function to encapsulate the main logic, making the script more modular and readable.
Error Logging: Added error logging using error_log to capture any errors when fetching content from URLs.
Consistent Error Handling: Used consistent error handling to terminate execution if any step fails.
Comments and Readability: Improved comments and code structure for better readability and maintainability.

# Usage:
Save the Script: Save the enhanced code to a file, e.g., exploit.php.
Run the Script: Execute the script using PHP:

`php exploit.php`

# Further Steps:
Test the Script: Run the script in a controlled environment and verify the output.
Analyze Results: Examine the final response for any signs of vulnerability or sensitive information exposure.
Log Analysis: Check error logs if any issues arise during execution.
